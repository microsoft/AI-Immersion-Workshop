    "# How to Quickly Start Competing in the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 with CNTK and LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we share a baseline script that allows anyone interested in participating in the [Data Science Bowl Lung Cancer Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017) to create the first submission quickly. We first extract features from the CT scan images of lungs using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented on [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki), followed by running a boosted tree classifier implemented on [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM).  Both CNTK and LightGBM have been shown to have excellent training speed in a range of tasks (see, for examples, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07249) for CNTK and [this summary](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#comparison-experiment) for LightGBM), and this should help participants iterate on their models quickly.  Furthermore, we use [GPU acceleration available on Azure Data Science Virtual Machines](http://aka.ms/dsvm/deeplearning) to speed up computations in CNN featurization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With these three tools, one can achieve a **score of 0.55979** on the leaderboard within approximately **two hours** (excluding data download and virtual machine startup time). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is also published as a [blog in Technet](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2017/02/17/quick-start-guide-to-the-data-science-bowl-lung-cancer-detection-challenge-using-deep-learning-microsoft-cognitive-toolkit-and-azure-gpu-vms/), as a [notebook in Cortana Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Notebook/Medical-Image-Recognition-for-the-Kaggle-Data-Science-Bowl-2017-with-CNTK-and-LightGBM-1) and as a [script in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hoaphumanoid/data-science-bowl-2017/cntk-and-lightgbm-quick-start/).  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) comes with CNTK, LightGBM, OpenCV, Scikit-learn preinstalled, so you don't have to worry about the configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the libraries, we are going to use a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) with the [ResNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). This configuration, developed by Microsoft Research, was the first CNN to surpass the human level performance in image classification. The network was trained in the [ImageNet dataset](http://image-net.org/) and can be downloaded [here](https://migonzastorage.blob.core.windows.net/deep-learning/models/cntk/imagenet/ResNet_152.model).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "In addition to the libraries you have to download the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/data) of the competition. The images are in [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) format and consist of a group of horizontal slices of the thorax for each patient. This is a 3D reconstruction of a sample lung with the competition data. It was computed with this [script](https://www.kaggle.com/gzuidhof/data-science-bowl-2017/full-preprocessing-tutorial).  \n",

    "The biggest file `stage1.7z` occupies 67Gb. When the file is uncompressed it occupies 141Gb. In case you need more space, you ca easily attach an external drive to your Azure VM. Here you can find the instructions for [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-attach-disk-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json). An alternative route is to attach a [fileshare disk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-how-to-use-files-linux). With [this script](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/scripts/blob/master/mount_azure_fileshare.sh) the fileshare can be attached in seconds in an Azure DSMV.\n"

    "## Alternative routes and improvements\n",
    "This notebook is just an example of what you can do with CNTK and LightGBM. Here we present some alternative routes that you can implement based on this script:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use other pretrained CNNs: As previously mentioned you can try other networks like [AlexNet](https://www.cntk.ai/Models/AlexNet/AlexNet.model), [AlexNet with Batch Normalization](https://www.cntk.ai/Models/AlexNet/AlexNetBS.model) and [ResNet with 18 layers](https://www.cntk.ai/Models/ResNet/ResNet_18.model). \n",
    "- Use transfer learning using a closer domain: The CNN we use is trained in ImageNet, which are natural images. There is another dataset called [LUNA](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/) that you can use to train a network and then perform transfer learning. A trick that might speed up the convergence is to initialize the weights with a pretrained model (like we are doing in the notebook). \n",
    "- Perform image augmentation: You can try to increment the training set by performing transformations in the images. For that you can apply different filters or rotate them.\n",
    "- Use a customize network with 3D images: CNTK allows [3D convolutions](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Convolution). On GPU, 1D, 2D and 3D convolutions will use cuDNN (fast), all other convolutions will use reference engine (slow). You can create a CNN that accepts 3D images. \n",
    "- Try tunning the parameters of the boosted tree: You can try to tune the parameters of the tree. For that LightGBM implements the sklearn function `GridSearchCV`. Here you have an [example](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/b0f7aa508a373b16adbda6cbe66b188a014964d8/examples/python-guide/sklearn_example.py).\n",
    "- Try some feature engineering: Before training the tree, the features are transformed. You can try to feed the tree without this operation or try a different one.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the competition was finished, some of the top performers published their solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second place solution**: Julian de Wit was able to get to the second place in the Kaggle competition. Here you can find his [blog](http://juliandewit.github.io/kaggle-ndsb2017/) and here his [code](https://github.com/juliandewit/kaggle_ndsb2017). The solution is based on nodule detectors with a 3D convolutional neural network architecture.\n",
    "- **Ninth place solution**: A team composed by Andreas Verleysen, Elias Vansteenkiste, Fréderic Godin, Ira Korshunova, Jonas Degrave, Lionel Pigou and Matthias Freiberger, all PhD students and postdocs at Ghent University, were able to reach the ninth position. They published a [blog](https://eliasvansteenkiste.github.io/machine%20learning/lung-cancer-pred/) and the [code](https://github.com/EliasVansteenkiste/dsb3). The pipeline has a 3D CNN for nodule segmentation, one CNN for false positive reduction, another CNN for identifying if the nodule is malignant or not, then transfer learning and finally ensembling.\n"
